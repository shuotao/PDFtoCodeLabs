Introduction

Helpful AI for All

Google Workspace with Gemini is AI built to offer help, not hype, for how you actually work and the goals you’re

driving. Whether you’re racing toward a deadline, launching a new product, pitching to a customer, or staying

connected with a global team, we believe technology should clear your path, not complicate it. For over 20

years, Workspace has been more than just a suite of tools; it’s been a place where teams create, build,

and grow together. We’ve empowered more than 11 million businesses of all sizes — from innovative startups

to global enterprises — to transform how they work. Now, as we move through the era of work powered by AI,

the opportunities emerging for our customers and our mission to help them thrive have only accelerated.

That’s why our premium AI is included in Workspace Business and Enterprise plans — giving every business

the tools they need to innovate for tomorrow integrated right into the apps you use every day.

Tools built for you: Getting the most out of Google Workspace with Gemini

As AI reshapes our world, our focus sharpens: Make powerful technology genuinely useful, today. Make it

accessible. Make it fit into your flow. Gemini is built to help and provides AI assistance embedded into the

Google Workspace apps you know and use including Gmail, Docs, Slides, Meet, Chat, Drive, and Sheets,

in addition to AI-first tools like NotebookLM, the Gemini app (the chat experience available at gemini.google.com

with enterprise-grade security), and Google Vids. The embedded generative AI-powered features can help you

write, organize information, create images and engaging videos, accelerate workflows, have richer meetings,

and much more. With access to your personal knowledge base in Drive, Docs, Gmail, and more, you can do your

best work faster with less tab switching and interruption.

You can access the features of Workspace with Gemini in multiple ways.

1.

In	apps	that	help	you	securely	brainstorm,	research,	draft,	and	more. You can use the Gemini app,

NotebookLM, and Google Vids to help you do your best work in new ways.

•  With the Gemini app, you can seamlessly transition from freeform brainstorming to highly structured
research reports using the Deep Research feature. With the Canvas feature, you can enter into an

iterative, collaborative space within the Gemini app where you can continually refine Gemini’s output

until you are happy with it. Once ready, you can export your work to a Doc to collaborate with others.

Access voice-to-text functionality to effortlessly chat with Gemini, create videos, and more.

•  NotebookLM can act as your AI research and thinking partner grounded in the information you trust.

You can upload various files and media to create a custom notebook that will provide precise citations.

From there, you can accelerate your learning and analysis by creating a Briefing	doc,	Audio	overview,

study guides, interactive mind maps, and more.

•  Google Vids is your AI-powered video, writing, production, and editing assistant, all in one. It can help

you create compelling videos for demos, company announcements, trainings, and more, with no special

expertise required of you. You can get started planning your video story with a simple prompt, record

yourself with a read-along teleprompter, or select an AI avatar to deliver a polished message. Generate

custom video clips using prompts with Veo, or add motion to images to complement your work. And,

you can collaborate and share seamlessly, just like you do in other Workspace apps like Docs or Slides.

2.  Directly embedded in the Workspace apps. You can engage with Gemini in your Workspace apps, which

allows you to create tailored AI outputs that are based on your own files and documents — even if they

aren’t Google Docs. You can generate personalized emails in seconds referencing your own Docs to pull in

relevant context, generate Slides that are based on information directly from your own briefs or reports,

and so much more. You can also access Gemini through in-line and one-click features. For example, as you

are writing in a Doc, look for the dynamic feature bar to access Help me write, or simply select the Gemini

icon in Meet to access Take notes for me, and more.

For 25 years, Google has built helpful, secure products that give users choice and control over their data.

It’s a bedrock principle for us. This was the case back when we first launched Gmail in 2004, and it remains

true in the era of AI. This means your data is your data and does not belong to Google. Your data stays in your

Workspace environment. Your privacy is protected. Your content is never used for targeting ads or to train

or improve Gemini or any other generative AI models, and is not reviewed by humans.

Get started with prompting:

Understanding what makes an effective prompt and learning to craft prompts on the fly can boost

your productivity and creativity when using AI. Gemini can help you:

•  Communicate with greater impact
•  Bring your creative vision to life
•  Turn complex information into clear insights
•  Accelerate learning and skill development
•  Make every meeting more productive and impactful
•  Research unfamiliar topics easily
•  Streamline your daily tasks and workflows

This guide provides you with the foundational skills to identify helpful use cases for your role and

tips on writing effective prompts when using Workspace with Gemini. You can think of a prompt

as a conversation starter with your AI-powered assistant. You might write several prompts as the

conversation progresses. While the possibilities are virtually endless, you can put consistent best

practices to work today.

The four main areas to consider when writing a basic, effective prompt are:

You are a program manager in [industry]. Draft an executive summary email to [persona] based on

[details about relevant program docs]. Limit to bullet points.

You don’t need to use all four components in every prompt, but using a few will help! Always remember to include

a verb or command as part of your task; this is the most important part of a prompt.

Six quick tips to get you started using Google Workspace with Gemini:

1.	 Use	natural	language. Write as if you’re speaking

4.  Make it a conversation. Fine-tune your prompts

to another person. Express complete thoughts

if the results don’t meet your expectations or if you

in full sentences.

2.	 Be	specific	and	iterate. Tell Gemini what you

need it to do (summarize, write, change the tone,

believe there’s room for improvement. Use follow-

up prompts and an iterative process of review and

refinement to yield better results.

create). Use both instructions (language that guides

5.  Use your documents. Personalize Gemini’s output

with information from your own files in Google Drive.

constraints (a set of limitations or boundaries on

the response; it limits what the model should avoid)

to help guide the output.

6.  Make Gemini your prompt assistant. Use

suggested actions and prompts that are contextually

suggested by Gemini. For example, open the side

3.  Be concise and avoid complexity. State your

panel in Gmail, and select one of the suggested next

request in brief — but specific — language.

steps, such as: “Show me a longer summary,” or

Avoid jargon.

“What are the action items?”

Prompting is a skill we can all learn. You don’t have to be a prompt engineer to use generative AI.

However, you will likely need to try a few different approaches for your prompt if you don’t get your

desired outcome the first time.

Generative AI and all of its possibilities are exciting, but it’s still new. Even though our models are getting

better every day, prompts can sometimes have unpredictable responses. Before putting an output from

Gemini into action, review it to ensure clarity, relevance, and accuracy. And of course, keep the most

important thing in mind: Generative AI is meant to help humans but the final output is yours.

The example prompts in this guide are meant for illustrative purposes.

typing @file name. Other prompts are presented without variables highlighted

to show you what a full prompt could look like. All of the prompts in this guide

are meant to inspire you, but ultimately they will need to be customized to help

you with your specific work.

NEW Use case: Build customer relationships

You just had a great call with a customer and now you want to use the notes you took from the meeting in

Google Docs to draft an email to the customer. In the Google Doc with your notes, you prompt Gemini in Docs by

selecting Help	me	write. You type:

Compose a personalized follow-up email to [client] following an initial conversation. Summarize the key

points we discussed and address any outstanding questions. (Gemini in Docs)

The account has just adopted one of the company’s service offerings and you need to ensure that they feel

supported during the onboarding process. You want to make sure you check in on how things are progressing

once a week, but you want to explore what the emails could look like. You open a new Google Doc and prompt

Gemini in Docs by selecting Help me write. You type:

Draft four email templates to check in on my customer weekly now that they have purchased our new

[service]. Use one value proposition (cost, ease of use, security, availability, and customization) as the

main topic for each email, and include [call to action] in each message. (Gemini in Docs)

NEW Use case: Prepare for new customer calls

You have an upcoming call with a prospect. This is a brand new use case for you, and you need help preparing

for the call. You visit The Gemini app, and then you type:

Draft a customized script for me to follow during my sales call with a prospect. The call will happen over

a video call and is set to last 30 minutes. Make sure to add the following in the script: how [company

products/solutions] can help address potential customer’s pain points, how [company]’s delivery

system guarantees seamless and timely delivery, competitive pricing and volume-discount table, and

space for a customer reference in the [customer’s industry] industry. (The Gemini app)

Now that you’ve done initial research, you export your findings to a new Google Doc. You open the Google Doc

and continue working. Now, you want to create a tailored pitch. Using the Google Doc with all of your research

notes, you prompt Gemini in Docs by selecting Help	me	write. You type:

Generate an elevator pitch for [product name] and include key benefits, competitive points of

differentiation, and the pain points that [product name] solves for. (Gemini in Docs)

You have a great start to your elevator pitch and short talking points. You want to use this to further anticipate

how the customer call might go. You resume your meeting preparation by returning to The Gemini app. You type:

I have an upcoming call with a prospect. [Use case] is a new use case for me, and I need help preparing

for the call. List the most likely objections [customer] might have for me during a sales call, with

suggestions on how to respond to them. I work in [insert industry], and I am trying to sell [product]. Also

provide ideas on how to handle objections and suggest ways to respond. (The Gemini app)

Leveling up your
prompt writing

This guide is meant to serve as inspiration, and the possibilities are nearly endless with Google

Workspace with Gemini. Build on your prompt-writing skills using these tips.

• Break it up. If you want Gemini to perform several related tasks, break them into separate

prompts.

• Give constraints. To generate specific results, include details in your prompt such as character

count limits or the number of options you’d like to generate.

•	Assign	a	role. To encourage creativity, assign a role. You can do this by starting your prompt with

language like: “You are the head of a creative department for a leading advertising agency …”

•	Ask	for	feedback. In your conversation with The Gemini app, tell it that you’re giving it a project,

include all the relevant details, and then describe the output you want. Continue the conversation

with questions like, “What questions do you have for me that would help you provide the best

output?”

• Consider tone. Tailor your prompts to suit your intended audience. Ask for outputs to have a

specific tone, such as formal, informal, technical, creative, or casual.

•	Say	it	another	way. Fine-tune your prompts if the results don’t meet your expectations or if you

believe there’s room for improvement. An iterative process of review and refinement often yields

better results.

Generative AI and all of its possibilities are exciting, but it’s still new. Even

though our models are getting better every day, prompts can sometimes have

unpredictable responses.

Before putting an output from Workspace with Gemini into action, review it to

ensure clarity, relevance, and accuracy. And of course, keep the most important

thing in mind: Generative AI is meant to help humans, but the final output is yours.

The example prompts in this guide are meant for illustrative purposes.
